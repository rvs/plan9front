This directory contains a port of the Plan 9 9k kernel to 64-bit
RISC-V systems, specifically RV64GC systems.  It currently only runs
on the Microchip Polarfire Icicle, Starfive Visionfive 2, and
discontinued Hifive Unmatched and pre-release Beagle V boards, but
should be relatively easy to adapt to future RV64GC systems.  SiFive
designs have worked best.

The Nezha board's u-boot lacks PXE booting, so it's a non-starter.  An Rvb-ice
port is in progress but seriously stalled; it is incompatible (if not buggy)
in a few respects.  You will find debugging code, particularly at start-up,
mostly tagged with "C910".

Set the ARCH environment variable to the target RISC-V architecture (e.g.,
"pf" for Icicle, "um" for Unmatched) before invoking mk.

Please read ../doc/*.pdf.

To print KZERO and the reboot trampoline base address (RBKTZERO) for the
current ARCH,

	mk -f kzmkfile
