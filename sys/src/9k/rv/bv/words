beagle v
discontinued 30 July 2021; might work on starfive visionfive v1 (jh7100)

starfive jh7100 risc-v rv64gc cpu: dual-core sifive u74 @ 1GHz
â€¢ U74 are dual-issue cores.
39-bit virtual addresses in rv64
8GB ram in two banks, with framebuffer memory after 1st 1GB and 6GB after
opensbi 0.9 (sbi 0.2?)
proprietary l2 cache controller, 2MB but not DMA coherent
cpus are cache coherent but dma is not (to be fixed in jh7110)
has standard clint & plic interrupt controllers
synopsis "gmac" Gb ether
hdmi, video accelerators - which one?
xhci
microsd card
