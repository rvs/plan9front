working:
visionfive 2	works
polarfire icicle works well except no pxe autoboot.  fix: newer u-boot.
tinyemu		works, single core, sv48 or sv39, M mode, no sbi, no u-boot.

discontinued:
beagle v	works, modulo hw bugs.
unmatched	may work, if sbi doesn't lie about hart status.

broken:
rvb-ice		wedges or ill. inst. after starting paging.  u-boot "go"
		starts in M mode.  can't find how linux works.

hopeless:
nezha		can't pxe boot.  abandoned.  fix: better u-boot.
