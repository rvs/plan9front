The SG2042 (as in the TH1520) uses its physical address space
perversely, especially given 39-bit virtual addresses.

physical 0 - 256G is ram, that consumes the lower address range.
physical 256G - 320G is pcie space;
	320G - 448G is free; virtual space could be mapped to first 128G
			of low ram, ignoring the rest;
	448G - 451G is peripherals;
	451G - 512G is free, so far; could be 61G of more low ram.
that's the whole Sv39 space.

KZERO == 320G is awkward;
it's not contiguous 1 bits high and contiguous 0 bits low,
so that affects physical/kernel mappings.
could map KZERO->0 for ram, and KZERO+128G->256G for pcie space.
could vmap pcie+peripherals to virtual top, use rest of high virtual for ram.

moving all the assigned upper space to the end would have freed
up a big block for trivial mapping of ram.
using Sv48 would have allowed for less cramped assignments.

possible mapping:
kzero == -256G

virtual		physical
-------		--------
kzero		0		ram
kzero+189G	0x70...		peripherals
-64G		0x40...		pcie
-1		-1
