Several things are needed early in system start up, and they often
have circular dependencies:

- on a risc, set static base register
- interrupts off
- park secondary cpus
- zeroed bss
- set up stack for function calls.  can probably call C now.
- printing, maybe by uart, for debugging, including formatted output
	- should work even before malloc does

- malloc, including memory sizing
- timed delays for drivers
- mmu on for paging, initially with identity map.
	also, map device registers uncached into KSEG0 space.
- clock interrupts

- call C if not already in C
