You'll need this fix to APE:

diff /n/dump/2020/0908/sys/src/ape/lib/ap/plan9/_buf.c .
61c60
< 		mux = (Muxseg*)_SEGATTACH(0, "shared", MUXADDR, sizeof(Muxseg));
---
> 		mux = (Muxseg*)_SEGATTACH(0, "shared", 0, sizeof(Muxseg));

MUXADDR is ~100MB, so it would collide with the allocation
of memory for the emulated system.
